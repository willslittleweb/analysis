        <h1>Reconstructing the <i>Dreamspace V</i> disaster:<br>What happened at Riverside Park, second by second</h1>
        <p>Published February 18, 2026</p>

<br><p><i>Dreamspace V</i> was a large inflatable art piece created by artist Maurice Agis. It was a colorful installation that allowed visitors to enter into what was intended to feel like another dimension. In July of 2006, the structure came loose of its moorings from a strong gust of wind and began flying through the air with people still inside. By the time the dust settled, 2 women lay dead and many others would be injured.</p>

<h1>_________________________</h1>
<h1>Who was Maurice Agis?</h1>
<p>Chapter 1</p>

<br><p>Maurice Agis was a British artist, sculptor, and optimist who was known for creating large, interactive artworks for the public to enjoy. Born in 1931 as an orphan, despite never meeting his parents, he said he never felt alone because he was always surrounded by caring people. This overtly positive outlook would persist as a personality trait throughout his life. He studied artistry at St. Martin’s School of Art in London, and after graduating began working at the Dutch Ministry of Education. However, he found that art galleries were unsatisfactory to him. Wanting to do more large scale arts, he collaborated with a man named Peter Jones to create <i>Spaceplace,</i> the first of many walk-through art pieces he would create. Spaceplace was installed at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford in 1966. The next year, in 1967, it was moved to Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.</p>

<p>After an entire 20 years of collaboration, Jones and Agis seperated, and Agis created his first solo project, <i>Colourspace.</i> However, in 1986, <i>Colourspace</i> lifted off due to winds and injured 5 people. However, Agis faced virtually no legal consequences, as the incident was ruled to be caused solely by an Act of God. Following the <i>Colourspace</i> disaster, Agis decided to create a new series of art pieces, a series that would go down in history: <i>Dreamspace.</i> <i>Dreamspace</i> involved inflatable structures were flat and consisted of multiple units that were arranged into an abstract design. The first <i>Dreamspace</i>, <i>Dreamspace I,</i> was created in 1996 as part of a celebration.</p>

<h1>_________________________</h1>
<h1><i>Dreamspace V</i></h1>
<p>Chapter 2</p>

<br><p><i>Dreamspace V</i> was a large PVC-based inflatable walk-in art piece. It was part of a series first commissioned in 1996 during the European City of Culture celebrations in Copenhagen, Denmark. Prior to <i>Dreamspace V</i>, there were 4 other inflatables created by Agis: <i>Dreamspace I, Dreamspace II, Dreamspace III,</i> and <i>Dreamspace IV.</i> They were all created within the timeframe of 1996-2004. They too were all large PVC-based inflatable walk-in art pieces. Their operations and schedules always went according to Agis’ plan, unlike <i>Dreamspace V.</i> Once <i>Dreamspace IV</i> was retired, construction of <i>Dreamspace V</i> began. Premiering in 2004, it was half the length of a football field; 165 feet in width and length (50 m) and ~16 feet in height (5 m). Its build involved 152 units, or ‘cells,’ that were separated into 4 multicolored groups and interconnected and arranged into an abstract design, all of which were either red, yellow, green, blue, or white. At the entrance, there were 2 large domes for visitors to pay, dress, and enter the structure. Once inflated, visitors could walk through the seemingly infinite tunnels and voids created between the units and experience a sense of awe, amazement, nostalgia, or surrealism. The requirements were to wear socks while inside and to wear gowns while inside to enhance the overall experience, or, according to Agis, to ‘become part of the artwork’ and were told to ‘lose themselves inside it.’</p>

<p><i>Dreamspace V</i> had overall positive reviews from people of any age, and the concept of it had been done multiple times in the previous 10 years by Agis. The arts council gave the green light for the installation being presented to the public in multiple towns, including a festival in Chester-le-Street, allowing Agis to bring his art to a wider public. Before the installation at Chester-le-Street, <i>Dreamspace V</i> had made a stop in Brouhaha International Festival in Liverpool temporarily. While in Liverpool though, a few hours before it was meant to open, vandals entered the grounds and slashed the PVC structure with knives, resulting in deflation and causing a delayed opening for repairs. During its stay in Liverpool, it was also closed multiple times due to stronger winds than anticipated, with visitors inside asked to leave. Following the act of vandalism, 3 of the inflatable pillars created by the units were replaced and <i>Dreamspace V</i> was scheduled to move to it’s next location: Riverside Park, County Durham, England.</p>

<h1>The <i>Dreamspace V</i> disaster</h1>
<p>Chapter 3</p>

<br><p>On July 22nd, 2006, <i>Dreamspace V</i> was officially installed in Riverside Park, Chester-le-Street as part of a festival. The inflatable structure Agis had installed in Chester-le-Street was the fifth of the <i>Dreamspace</i> series, hence the ‘V’ in ‘Dreamspace V.’ Once installed, it had been moored to the ground with 31 stakes, 9 less than the standard safety requirement. No problems arose on the 22nd of July, because the day was not particularly windy. However, the same cannot be said for July 23rd. On July 23rd, before the structure had even opened, a cleaner inside <i>Dreamspace V</i> noted that the floor of <i>Dreamspace V</i> was beginning to ‘ripple.’ After opening to the people of the festival, the same thing began happening. Agis himself was present at the time, and he was informed about this, to which he responded to attach more stakes and tethers to the structure. Unfortunately, what people failed to realize is that the ‘rippling’ was a result of wind getting underneath the structure causing it to slightly lift. Around at the same time, 68-year-old Elizabeth Collings visited the area with the rest of her family. They had originally seen the inflatable in the distance and curiosity got the best of them. Elizabeth’s grandson was eager to enter, while Elizabeth and the others were a bit more reluctant but eventually Elizabeth did go in, joking that she was going to ‘find peace and serenity.’ Elizabeth’s husband and daughter sat at a table nearby to drink tea. After conversing for an unspecified amount of time, the ripples inside <i>Dreamspace V</i> were beginning to become more pronounced and violent, until the entire structure itself was beginning to move. Elizabeth’s husband, noticing this, thought it was some sort of carnival ride and stated he wished he had gone on. Susan Campbell, Elizabeth’s daughter, turned her head to see the structure beginning to move, to which she simply responded, "It’s not a ride."</p>

<p><i>Dreamspace at Riverside Park</i></p>

<p>At 11:42:17 A.M., the <i>Dreamspace V</i> structure began to lift off the ground, starting from the rear and moving up to the front. In front of hundreds of people, the inflatable structure folded over on itself and began hurdling through the air to the northeast, almost crushing multiple people. Bodies were observed falling out of the structure that was now moving through the air at alarming speeds. The structure crossed a road before colliding with a CCTV pole at 11:42:49, yanking it backwards, unfolding it and finally ending the disaster. People began rushing toward the structure and began trying to tear it open with their hands or with miscellaneous items they had on them at the time. Agis himself had been standing at the entrance when it happened, and when he realized what was going on, he tried to hold down the structure in a desperate attempt to save his masterpiece, but it was clearly of no use, as Agis was dropped onto the ground, stunned, and could only watch as his artwork began flying through the air. His girlfriend, Paloma Brotons, later stated she feared that Agis had been killed when he fell onto the ground. Of the ~30 people that were inside the structure, 13-27 people were injured. Unfortunately, Elizabeth Collings, who had been reluctant to enter the structure, suffered devastating injuries and did not survive. 38-year-old Claire Furmedge, a bright mother of 2 daughters, had also been inside the structure when it lifted off and passed away. Collings and Furmedge would be the only 2 fatalities of the incident, both of which were ejected when the structure was in the air. The event had been captured by multiple cameras. What was left behind was a deflated <i>Dreamspace V</i> and what witnesses described as a ‘field of bodies.’ EMS was called to the scene and immediately rushed those in critical condition to the hospital and estabilished an on-scene triage, and firefighters immediately began cutting open the PVC and pulled mortally wounded survivors out of the structure. Agis was taken away from the scene immediately in a police cruiser, and to the police he spoke of his shock and disbelief at what happened and stated that as the creator of <i>Dreamspace V</i> itself, he had to accept responsibility for what happened.  This was not the first time something like this happened with Agis’ artwork; in 1986, during an exhibition in the German seaside town of Travemünde, his creation known as <i>Colourspace</i> broke free from its moorings during a sudden storm. Though no one had died, it was a major safety violation. <i>Dreamspace V</i> itself had lifted on an earlier occasion, however it was not at this level of disaster. The Durham County Police confiscated the remains of <i>Dreamspace V</i> and its moorings and launched a lengthy investigation. Foul play was not completely ruled out, but eventually was. It was determined as an accident by the investigation, as at the moment <i>Dreamspace V</i> lifted, there was a large gust of wind that without a doubt contributed to the disaster. In CCTV footage, you can observe trees go from stationary to blowing dominantly in one direction at 11:42:13. On top of this, it occurred in mid July, and the air outside was hot, and it may have caused a ‘hot air balloon’ effect as the air inside <i>Dreamspace V</i> heated. Legal proceedings concluded that the event organizer, Brouhaha International, and the Chester-le-Street District Council were primarily responsible for the tragedy. The judge ordered Brouhaha to pay 55% and the Council to pay 45% of compensatory damages. As for Agis himself, he was tried for gross negligence and 2 manslaughter charges in 2009. Some investigators concluded that Agis had not contemplated or assessed whether the moorings for <i>Dreamspace V</i> were adequate for the foreseeable weather conditions. However, the jury failed to reach a verdict after 11 hours, and were subsequently discharged. During the same trial, Agis was found guilty of breaching the Health and Safety of Work Act of 1974. Later, he was fined £10,000 for failing to ensure public safety. The Crown Prosecution Service decided to not pursue a retrial on the manslaughter charges, their reasoning being Agis’ age and poor health. Only 8 months after being fined, in October of 2009, Agis passed away at the age of 77 in Spain. His remains were cremated and his ashes were put in 4 seperate urns that were red, blue, green, and yellow, mirroring the colors of the <i>Dreamspace</i> series. While he had been physically ill for a while beforehand, some others speculate the anxiety caused by the legal proceedings themselves and the guilt and constant reminders of the accident itself played a role in his death, though this is unconfirmed. According to a relative of an injured child, Agis never apologized.</p>

<h1>Reconstructing the <i>Dreamspace V</i> disaster</h1>
<p>Chapter 4</p>

<br><p>Present at Riverside Park that day was a CCTV camera set, with more than or equal to 27 security cameras being scattered throughout the park, 2 of which caught the disaster on film. The first known video is the most infamous video to exist of the accident. It was captured by a CCTV camera mounted on a large pole to offer an aerial view of the area for constant surveillance. It is the only known video to capture the initial liftoff of <i>Dreamspace V</i>. <i>Dreamspace V</i>, after folding over on itself, began hurdling through the air toward the pole until the sculpture violently collided with it—yanking the inflatable backwards and finally putting it to rest. The camera, rolling at 1 FPS, captured the inflatable rapidly approaching the screen, crushing a family’s picnic setup, running over a tree, until the only thing that can be seen is the rough PVC covering the camera as the inflatable snags it. The last shot it captures is the fabric wrapped around the pole beneath it. Multiple people can be seen running away in panic as the structure flies, one of which was from the picnic setup and almost got crushed by the structure themselves, visibly the last person to be caught by the camera. Its duration is 55 seconds. The second CCTV camera was setup on a different pole situated next to a parking lot. While it was turned in the direction of the parking lot for the majority of the disaster, during the latter portions, after the structure snagged the pole, the camera turned it’s lens toward the structure, either motion detected or was manually moved, and captured the structure rapidly deflating and falling backwards. It offers the widest view we have of the incident, with the entire park, the panicked crowd, and the giant <i>Dreamspace V</i> all visible in the footage. Its duration is 39 seconds. The 2 videos can be seen below, timecoded to real time in the bottom left corner. These 2 videos were shown to the jury during court.</p>

<p>Other than the security videos, 2 people were recording the structure as it was flying through the air. The first handheld video was from a man in blue, possibly named Harry Smith, filming right behind the CCTV camera that was snagged. His video is the only video of the disaster with audio, note the wind howling and people screaming. He captures the inflatable rolling onto the ground before sliding against the ground toward him and the pole. After filming for a few seconds, he yells, and begins sprinting away. After a few seconds, the video resumes, capturing the moments after the inflatable hit the CCTV pole, a rare angle from the north. This video was featured on the news 3-4 days after the accident. The original video surfaced on a website affiliated with ITN, and the video was then added to Getty Images on April 26, 2017. The video from the original source had a man voicing over the video, stating "This was the moment captured on a mobile phone, when a family day of fun turned into disaster." The first segment is 10 seconds and the second is 6, totaling to 16 seconds. The original Getty Images pages featuring both segments can be found by clicking <a href="www.gettyimages.com/detail/video/inflatable-sculpture-accident-kills-2-people-in-chester-news-footage/673574716">here </a>and <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/video/inflatable-sculpture-accident-kills-2-people-in-chester-news-footage/673597036">here. </a>It is highly reccomended you view these original pages. The second and final video of the disaster was a handheld video filmed by an unidentified person. They were standing in the middle of the field itself and was directly in front of the structure when it took off, but only began recording when it snagged the CCTV pole. The filmer captured the immediate impact of the CCTV pole, followed by the inflatable deflating into nothing but a pile of PVC. The silent video shows the panic of the people around, as people, including the filmer, began rushing toward the inflatable to try and help the injured. It is the clearest visual of the inflatable snagging the CCTV pole and is one of the clearest videos of the accident itself. Its duration is 21 seconds. It originated from an old Metro news page that shows the video with a brief caption. The original file is an FLV file that now fails to load on the page, and is only accessible by reviewing the source code. The Metro page can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260222181752/https://metro.co.uk/video/dreamspace-jurors-discharged-1264211/">here.</a> The original FLV file is hosted on videos.metro.co.uk by the name of <a href="https://videos.metro.co.uk/videos/32439484001/32439484001_45832971001_Dreamspace-jurors-discharged-32869.flv">32439484001_45832971001_Dreamspace-jurors-discharged-32869.flv</a>. One of these 2 videos were shown during court as evidence, aswell as both CCTV videos. These 2 handheld videos can be found below, timecoded to real time.</p>

<p>While these 4 videos are rare on their own, the sheer number of visitors during the festival suggest that there might still be undiscovered footage floating around in some places of the internet that have just not been uncovered yet. If this were true, they or their sources are likely now defunct. Another possibility is that home videos of the incident are rotting somewhere forgotten in people’s homes that are just waiting to either be thrown out or posted to the public. If you believe you have found new footage of the incident, or have footage of it, I highly advise you to post it online.</p>

<p>When you synchronize and stabilize these videos, it becomes clear the inflatable began traveling to the northeast and did not veer from its direction. It was in the air for approximately 37 seconds and another 13 seconds to deflate. Inertia from the CCTV pole can clearly be seen yanking the structure backwards before deflation, likely causing multiple injuries to the people inside. Deflation also may have suffocated many visitors. Below, you can watch all angles synced to real time, along with one witness video stabilized. Near the end, photos appear in the exact moment they are taken.</p>

<p>Using this data, we can create a diagram of the accident. Below you can see this diagram compared to the diagram that was added in the newspaper coverage. The 4 video vantage points are marked onto the satellite imagery, and the location of the <i>Dreamspace V</i> inflatable is mapped out. The purple line starting at the center of <i>Dreamspace V</i> is the trajectory it took when it was lifted. This data also allows us to map out the incident as it happened in real time. The inflatable initially went south, before folding and taking a sharp turn to the north, and then veered northeast toward the pole and did not change direction after this. Its trajectory can be described as a checkmark shape. You can watch the video below for a real time view of the accident. The black rhombus is the location of the <i>Dreamspace V</i> inflatable. It is important to keep in mind the actual inflatable was much larger in size. The red triangle near the top of the video is the FOV of the security camera mounted on the pole that was struck. The red triangle near the bottom of the map is the FOV of the security camera that kept the parking lot under surveillance. Real time is indicated in the corner of the map. The 2 blue dots in the map are the entrance domes to <i>Dreamspace V</i>.</p>

<p>Using this video, we can draw inferences that the time between the structure starting to move northeast and the impact on the CCTV pole was almost exactly 10 seconds. The distance it translated between this was 173 feet (or 52.59 meters.) Using distance/time, <i>Dreamspace V</i>’s approximate foward speed after folding over was 11.8 mph (or 5.28 m/s) as it dragged itself across the field. From 11:42:26 to 11:42:32, <i>Dreamspace V</i> rotated approximately 67° clockwise in a total of 6.5 seconds. Using degrees/time, <i>Dreamspace V</i> was likely moving 10.308°/s (or 0.18 rad/s) during this timeframe. We can find the velocity of <i>Dreamspace V</i> during this time using <i>v</i> = <i>rw</i>. Since <i>Dreamspace V</i> was 50 meters across, its radius would be 25 meters. Its angular velocity would be 0.18 rad/s from our previous calculation. This means the velocity of <i>Dreamspace V</i> would be equal to 25x0.18. The product of 25x0.18 is 4.5, which means it's velocity during this time was 4.5 m/s. This is 0.78 away from 5.28. This indicates that the initial liftoff may have involved a centripetal swing, in fact, you can even observe the leftmost edge of Dreamspace remain in the same general location for 2 seconds in the initial liftoff in the security footage, indicating the stakes and tethers on that side were the last to give way. What the close numbers also suggests is that a lot of the aerodynamic lift was converted into rotational momentum before the final tether snapped. Given that <i>Dreamspace V</i>’s length and width was 50 meters and its height was 5 meters, we can infer the volume of <i>Dreamspace V</i> was ~12,500m³ (441433.334 ft³.) With an inflatable this large, the behavior when it was subject to the winds was likely more directed by its buoyancy and momentum than just the raw weight of the PVC. Likely using the information we know on <i>Dreamspace V</i>, the court estimated the gust of wind to be traveling ~12-15 mph. The gust was also traveling to the south-southwest. Prior to the gust, winds had already been affecting <i>Dreamspace V</i>, with winds getting underneath the structure and causing the ‘ripples’ that were observed by staff and visitors, some ripples even reached 5 feet above the ground.</p>

<p>We can better visualize the complex, maze-like interior of <i>Dreamspace V</i> by mapping out the structure and then pinpointing where photos inside were taken. An example can be seen below, with all of the image’s FOVs in dark. The image in the center does not have an FOV because it is 360°. Another visual of the inside is a 360° video of a man named Andy Millns walking through the structure, with his camera’s position marked on the model of the structure in real time. See below.</p>

</video>

<p>An important thing to note is that <i>Dreamspace V</i> almost never fully lifted from the ground, it was touching the ground throughout the entirety of the disaster, but it was mostly vertical. The 30 feet in the air likely comes from the first few seconds of the disaster, where the wind chasing the ‘ripples’ from before became too strong and lifted parts the structure off the ground, staring from the north side and then moving its way to lift the east side wildly off the ground. During this lift, the structure rotated. During this timeframe, the structure can be described as turned to a 45 degree angle on the pitch axis. The lifted part of the structure then clamped together, folding the structure. The 2 folds began flying through the air while a different part of the structure remained laying on the ground. As the folded portions began flying, it picked up the portions that were on the ground until the entire base was simply dragging itself against the ground, titled forward, while was the top tilted backwards. It continued this until it reached the CCTV pole, which wrapped parts of the PVC around it. Initially, the structure continued hurdling forward like nothing happened until the PVC reached it’s stretching capacity and immediately stopped the structure from progressing, the structure immediately unfolding and twisting back into a flat plain and remained vertical in the air for about 2 seconds before rapidly deflating onto the ground.</p>

<p>Potential new footage of the disaster is almost certainly still online in some places. One example is BBC’s article "Dreamspace artist was ‘negligent.’" It went over the charges Maurice Agis faced in wake of the disaster. However, below lines of text is an embedded file and text that reads "Footage of the moment Dreamspace broke free was shown to the jury." The Ruffle Flash emulator gets stuck on a loading screen trying to play the Flash file. Its duration is listed as ‘135’ in the source code. Given the context given, this video is most likely the CCTV videos. However, this could also be a unique handheld video that has not gotten the attention it deserves yet. Going into the source code shows the ID of the file is ‘embeddedPlayer_7857110.’ If you know or think you know how to find the actual video better than me, I highly recommend to try to do so. An archived version of the article can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20090131020735/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7856121.stm</p>

<p>Another example of potential unique footage can be found at a separate BBC article, titled "Artist's dream for maze of colour." Published the day after the accident, it recounts the story of Maurice Agis and his <i>Dreamspace series</i>. Attached to it is an image of Agis inside <i>Dreamspace IV</i>, and underneath that image there is a play button with the word ‘VIDEO’ next to it, labeled ‘Sculpture tragedy.’ Clicking the button results in an error message as of 2026. The link the button leads to is http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/player/nol/newsid_5200000/newsid_5209000?redirect=5209016.stm&news=1&nbwm=1&bbwm=1&bbram=1&nbram=1&asb=1. This link is unfortunately not archived.

<p>The 2 fatalities during the incident were 2 women who were both visiting the area with their families. Autopsy would have determined that the cause of death was possible traumatic asphyxia from being suffocated by <i>Dreamspace V</i> and blunt force trauma when both fell from the structure onto the pavement of the pathway below. The most likely timeframe they fell from the structure was 11:42:39-11:42:52. To better understand what happened second by second, a timeline of events has been added below. The disaster itself only happened within about a minute, so the times many events happened are most likely separated by mere seconds and happened at 11:42.

<p><b>Timeline of Events</b></p>

<p><b>11:42:10</b>: <i>Dreamspace V</i> slightly lifts off the ground.<br><b>11:42:13</b>: The wind gust that doomed <i>Dreamspace V</i> strikes.<br><b>11:42:17</b>: <i>Dreamspace V</i> begins lifting off starting from the north side.<br><b>11:42:25</b>: <i>Dreamspace V</i> almost completely lifts off the ground and rotates 67°.<br><b>11:42:28</b>:The east side of <i>Dreamspace V</i> flails about 30 feet above the ground.<br><b>11:42:32</b>: <i>Dreamspace V</i> violently folds itself.<br><b>11:42:34</b>: The folded portions of <i>Dreamspace V</i> begin flying through the air.<br><b>11:42:39</b>: <i>Dreamspace V</i> remains in contact with the ground and crushes a picnic setup.<br><b>11:42:42</b>: <i>Dreamspace V</i> rolls onto the ground and begins sliding itself foward.<br><b>11:42:46</b>: <i>Dreamspace V</i> runs over a tree.<br><b>11:42:49</b>: <i>Dreamspace V</i> plows into a CCTV pole.<br><b>11:42:52</b>: <i>Dreamspace V</i> stops moving forward once the PVC reaches stretching capacity.<br><b>11:42:53</b>: <i>Dreamspace V</i> fully untwists itself. It is near vertical in the air.<br><b>11:42:54</b>: <i>Dreamspace V</i> begins deflating and collapsing onto the ground.<br><b>11:43:01</b>: A deflating <i>Dreamspace V</i> falls backward.<br><b>11:43:09</b>: By this time, <i>Dreamspace V</i> is nothing but a pile of PVC.</p>

<p>These timestamps, along with the real time timestamp edited into the videos, were made from the very low quality timestamps on the CCTV camera footages, seen at the very bottom. These 4 videos are the only visuals we have of the disaster as it happened in real time. Unless new footage were discovered, either from the links I added here or not, no other known video clip exists. Surprisingly enough, photos of the disaster are relatively scarce. While we mainly have videos, many "photos" of the disaster were simply stills from videos. All the photos of the disaster were taken either after <i>Dreamspace V</i> had been neutralized and was deflating, or after <i>Dreamspace V</i> had been completely stabbed and deflated into nothing but PVC fabric sprawled out onto the ground, which I find unusual. You’d think it would likely be easier to pull out a phone or camera and snap a picture than to pull out a phone or camera and begin recording in the few seconds <i>Dreamspace V</i> began flying. However, it seemed the opposite was at play here. Below, I have added every image I could find of the Dreamspace V accident.</p>

<p>While finding these images, I noticed that these 2 specific images were taken in very close proximity in time. You can tell by the position of the inflatable and by the locations of the colored cells. The one on the top was taken from the southwest, while the one on the bottom was taken from the southeast.</p>

<p>One thing I also noted is that in some photos you can see the CCTV pole that <i>Dreamspace V</i> ultimately snagged and finally put a stop to the disaster. In a few aftermath photos is visible in the background, and in a few photos you can even see the PVC wrapped around the base of the pole. Below are 2 examples put side by side.</p>

<p>Another thing that is apparent is that there are very little photos of the inflatable from the outside that weren't taken during the disaster. The first photo, which originated from now-sold www.dreamspace-agis.com, was of an earlier version of <i>Dreamspace V</i>. The second photo, which is the clearest of <i>Dreamspace V</i>, was taken while it was installed at Liverpool after emergency repairs following the vandalism. The third photo is of the inflatable at Riverside Park, likely only a day before the accident. The fourth and final visual we have is the frames from one of the CCTV cameras that were captured mere seconds before the inflatable lifted off. These 4 visuals can be seen below.</p>

<p>Overall, the approximate distance it traveled while guided by the wind was 368 feet, or 112.19 meters. However, we cannot do distance/time for this as it had speed changes during the beginning portions of the disaster. Using the known dimensions of <i>Dreamspace V</i> and the surface area formula (l*w + l*h + w*h), we can estimate the surface area of <i>Dreamspace V</i> to be 65010 ft² (or 6039.627 m²). However, it’s important to note that this number assumes <i>Dreamspace V</i> is simply a cube with the aforementioned dimensions, so it is an approximation. Newton’s First Law was also observed during the incident; in order for <i>Dreamspace V</i> to remain stationary, the force of gravity and the tension in the mooring cables must exceed the aerodynamic lift. Once this ceased, <i>Dreamspace V</i> broke free and was subject to the winds. Another theory states that the air outside was hot due to the summer, and air inside <i>Dreamspace V</i> began heating when it was installed. Eventually, the air inside the structure was less dense than the cooler air surrounding it. This resulted in a ‘hot air balloon’ effect, where the air's kinetic energy causes the balloon expand and become lighter. The same effect occurred with <i>Dreamspace V</i>, and the wind gusts definitely did not help. In short, once the moorings snapped, liftoff was inevitable. For convenience, and to better visualize <i>Dreamspace V</i>, below is a 3D model of the inflatable. This includes the 2 blue entrance pods and a pink cylinder acting as a size reference of the average human. You can download it by clicking <a href="https://idk1239494.github.io/wills-web/Dreamspace.glb">here.</a></p>

<p>Even using a simple 3D modeling software, like Tinkercad, allows us to map out Riverside Park in 3 dimensional view, adding key objects like trees, the picnic setup, and the CCTV pole. Once this was completed, the <i>Dreamspace V</i> model was imported, heavily modified, and placed into the appropriate position. Once this was done, the camera view was switched to the vantage points of filming locations of the accident: the first being CCTV video #1, the second being the Getty Images footage, and the third being the handheld video from the FLV file. See results below.</p>

<p>We are able to also overlay and image of <i>Dreamspace V</i> flying through the air over a picture of Riverside Park closer to more recent times to get a different visual on how the disaster could have looked like from other vantage points. See below.</p>

<p>The truth is that this disaster was almost certainly completely preventable, and unfortunately there is a lot that can go wrong with a walk-in inflatable that is this big. Agis never truly intended to hurt anyone, but with the a structure of this type it might as well have been a disaster just waiting to happen. There was incompetence from Agis, the Chester-le-Street council, and Brouhaha, had there have been more moorings on the inflatable 2 lives could have been saved. The disaster itself was highly disturbing and traumatizing to see in person, as something seemingly harmless becoming fatal and sprawling bodies across the field inflicting understandably caused long lasting mental damage in witnesses and especially survivors, both of which included young children. All of the injured have luckily been physically healed as of 2026. While 2 fatalities is 2 too many, had the inflatable missed the CCTV pole and continued marching onwards, the death toll could have been much higher had it have not been stopped so early. Directly to the east of the accident scene was a public pool installed at Riverside Park, in which people could have been easily ran over by the inflatable. It was by sheer luck that the inflatable went in the direction it did, and we should be thankful that it did.</p>

<h1>Legacy of <i>Dreamspace V</i></h1>
<p>Chapter 5</p>

<br><p>After the <i>Dreamspace V</i> disaster, the <i>Dreamspace</i> series was cancelled for obvious reasons. Agis vowed to never make such large works again, but he never got the chance to make another work. Temporary memorials were installed at Riverside Park for the victims of the incident. The incident resulted in major safety changes focused on stricter risk assessment. Riverside Park itself has regained a feeling of normalcy, but nothing will shake off the infamous events of July 23, 2006. The <i>Dreamspace</i> series is now forever remembered for the fifth and final piece that went from vibrant and happy to fatal and disastrous, with Agis’s career now remembered almost completely solely because of the events of that day. Agis himself suffered mental decline after the disaster, suffering from extreme guilt and was speechless for weeks afterward. The devastating disaster seared itself into the memory of everyone who witnessed it, by watching footage of it or seeing it in person, and we can hopefully use it as a lesson that safety is not a joke and tells us exactly what not to do when installing large artworks that are inflatable.</p>
